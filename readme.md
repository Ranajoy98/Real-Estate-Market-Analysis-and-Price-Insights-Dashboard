# Real Estate Market Analysis and Price Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

This comprehensive real estate analytics project leverages the Ames Housing Dataset to provide deep insights into property market trends, pricing patterns, and investment opportunities. Through advanced data visualization and statistical analysis, the project transforms raw housing data into actionable business intelligence for real estate professionals and investors.

## Key Achievements

### **Real Estate Market Analytics & Data Visualization**
- Analyzed **$208M property portfolio** across 20+ neighborhoods, processing 1,000+ transactions with median sale price of $165K and identifying NoRidge as top-performing market segment at $337K average sale price (82% above market average)

### **Predictive Property Valuation & Feature Impact Analysis**
- Developed multi-variable pricing analytics quantifying renovation ROI, demonstrating that excellent garage conditions command **68% price premiums** ($188K vs $112K) and properties with 2-3 fireplaces achieve $250K-270K sale prices compared to $140K for non-fireplace properties

### **Market Trend Analysis & Performance Optimization**
- Tracked **5-year housing market cycles (2006-2010)** identifying 49% market decline from $47M peak to $24M trough, while maintaining consistent transaction volumes of 230-259 annual sales and average lot sizes of 10,120 sq ft

### **Statistical Correlation Analysis & Business Intelligence**
- Established **strong positive correlation** between living area and sale prices using scatter plot analysis of 6,000+ sq ft properties, enabling predictive pricing accuracy within $20K range and identifying quality ratings as key value drivers with ratings 6-7 achieving $400K+ sale prices
