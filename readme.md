# Real Estate Market Analysis and Price Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Ames Housing Dataset is analyzed to identify property market trends, pricing patterns, and investment factors. Data visualization and statistical methods are applied to transform housing data into actionable insights for real estate analysis and decision-making.

## Strategy Recommendations

### Investment Location Strategy

- Target Premium Neighborhoods: Focus investment capital on NoRidge ($337K), Northridge Heights ($316K), and Somerset ($251K), which command 80%+ price premiums compared to the market average

- Avoid Underperforming Markets: Exercise caution in Edwards ($134K avg) and OldTown ($132K avg), which show consistently lower returns

### Property Feature Optimization

- Prioritize Garage Improvements: Upgrade garage conditions from Poor/Fair to Excellent to capture 68% price premiums ($188K vs $112K)

- Fireplace Installation ROI: Add 2-3 fireplaces to properties to achieve $250K–$270K sale prices, representing 78–92% premiums over non-fireplace properties ($140K)

- Foundation Upgrades: Target properties with PConc foundations which generate $121M total sales volume vs $67M for CBlock alternatives

### Market Timing & Acquisition Strategy

- Post-Cycle Acquisition: Leverage the 49% market decline pattern (2006–2010: $47M → $24M) to acquire distressed properties during troughs

- Volume Consistency Planning: Plan for stable transaction volumes (230–259 annual sales) regardless of price fluctuations for portfolio liquidity

### Renovation Investment Priorities

- High-Impact Renovations: Focus on garage condition improvements and fireplace additions for maximum ROI

- Pool Quality Enhancement: Upgrade pools to "Excellent" rating to achieve $490K average prices vs $170K for "Good"-rated

- Size-Price Optimization: Target properties in the 2,000–4,000 sq ft range where price-per-square-foot correlation is strongest

## Key Achievements

### **Real Estate Market Analytics & Data Visualization**
- Analyzed **$208M property portfolio** across 20+ neighborhoods, processing 1,000+ transactions with median sale price of $165K and identifying NoRidge as top-performing market segment at $337K average sale price (82% above market average)

### **Predictive Property Valuation & Feature Impact Analysis**
- Developed multi-variable pricing analytics quantifying renovation ROI, demonstrating that excellent garage conditions command **68% price premiums** ($188K vs $112K) and properties with 2-3 fireplaces achieve $250K-270K sale prices compared to $140K for non-fireplace properties

### **Market Trend Analysis & Performance Optimization**
- Tracked **5-year housing market cycles (2006-2010)** identifying 49% market decline from $47M peak to $24M trough, while maintaining consistent transaction volumes of 230-259 annual sales and average lot sizes of 10,120 sq ft

### **Statistical Correlation Analysis & Business Intelligence**
- Established **strong positive correlation** between living area and sale prices using scatter plot analysis of 6,000+ sq ft properties, enabling predictive pricing accuracy within $20K range and identifying quality ratings as key value drivers with ratings 6-7 achieving $400K+ sale prices
